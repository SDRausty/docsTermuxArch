When gpg: Generating pacman keyring master key appears on the screen, the installation process can be accelerated.  The system desires a lot of entropy at this part of the install procedure.  To generate as much entropy as possible quickly, watch and listen to a file on your device.

The program pacman-key will want as much entropy as possible when generating keys.  Entropy is also created through tapping, sliding, one, two and more fingers tapping with short and long taps.  When gpg: Generating pacman keyring master key appears on the screen, use any of these simple methods to accelerate the installation process if it is stalled.  Put even simpler, just do something on device.  Browsing files will create entropy on device.  Slowly swiveling the device in space and time will accelerate the installation process.  This method alone might not generate enough entropy (a measure of randomness in a closed system) for the process to complete quickly.  Use bash ~/arch/bin/we in a new Termux session to and watch entropy on device.

 🕛 = 🕛 Information about "Starting Arch Linux from Termux?" at https://github.com/sdrausty/TermuxArch/issues/25.  Use tour to run a very short tour to get to know the new Arch Linux in Termux PRoot environment you just set up a little bit better.  If there was more than one error during the update procedure and you would like to refresh the installation, use setupTermuxArch.sh refresh.  This will update and recreate the configuration provided.  The TermuxArch command keys helps install and generate Arch Linux keyring keys.
