â›” ERROR Unknown architecture! There might still be hope.

Check for other available architectures at http://mirror.archlinuxarm.org/os/ and see if any match your device.

If you find a match, then please submit a pull request at https://github.com/sdrausty/TermuxArch/pulls with script modifications.

Alternatively, submit a modification request at https://github.com/sdrausty/TermuxArch/issues if you find an architecture match. Please include output from `uname -mo` on the device in order to expand architecture autodetection for `setupTermuxArch.sh`.
